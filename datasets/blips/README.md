# Blips dataset

Simple synthetic dataset of 1D signal which could be use to test 1D CNN algorithms.

Implementation was inspired by dataset presented in course "End To End Machine Learning": [321. Convolutional Neural Networks in One Dimension](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/321-convolutional-neural-networks) by Brandon Rohrer: [https://github.com/brohrer](https://github.com/brohrer)

## Format

CSV file, first element is class label, then there is array of floats that represents signal.

## Usage

Update generate.rb file and run (`ruby generate.rb`) the script to get dataset with desired properties.
